## GUN PRINCESS

**Despite our shining civilizations, Lavato is still a world of mysteries.**

The greatest mysteries of all undeniably revolve around the matter of “Alteil”. I am penning this history to give the strategists of Alteil, the Iczers, a chance to better comprehend these mysteries. In this chapter I will discuss the young girl who established the Mercenary Kingdom, [Gun Princess Yuni].

**Yuni’s Early Life**

[Gun Princess Yuni] was born in a small town near the Grand Surface, an area on the outskirts of Lavato’s great empires. It was so named because it looks more like the barren surface of the moon through a spyglass than anything that belongs on Lavato. It is also referred to as the Great Wastelands or the Great Wastes.

During her early childhood, a violent gang attacked her town and murdered her parents. With no one to care for her, she was abandoned at the age of six on the Grand Surface. There, she saw a world where the only justice was power.

For a girl at the age of 6, the Grand Surface was most likely an extremely inhospitable place.

However, history tells us that in this cruel land, [Yuni] learned the art of survival.

She soon became an expert handler of firearms, and thus was able to protect herself against a variety of threats. At the time, pistols and rifles where springing up all across Lavato and were becoming a common sight.

<img style="float:left;margin-right:20px" src="http://tinyink.com.vn/ab/images/0232.jpg"/> The reason [Yuni] was able to become an expert with firearms was because of her encounter with Legendary Drifter [Ben MacLachlan]. It’s become something of a campfire story, but there are many records that indicate he gave [Yuni] her signature twin pistols.

[Ben MacLachlan] himself was a fixture of children’s stories even then. He was known as Fast Draw Ben, Silver Bullet Ben, or Hurricane Ben depending on the region. No one is sure exactly why [Yuni] caught his eye at that time.

Whatever the reason, he had excellent judgment, as [Yuni] became one of the greatest gunslingers on the Grand Surface. She became a bounty hunter, and the malicious and wanted criminals of the area all feared her.

Once her fame begin to grow, individuals started popping up claiming that they were [Yuni]’s companions. The record of this is extensive, and includes diaries, newspaper clippings and correspondence. The reasons behind this phenomenon are also unclear.

One possible explanation lies in the fact that [Yuni] was known for her friendly disposition. Even if she was just meeting someone for the first time, she would treat them as if they were long-time friends.

It wasn’t her intention, but over time more and more bounty hunters gathered around [Yuni], and they eventually became a mercenary band.

In fact, this is the origin of the Mercenary Nation, Heierrat.

**Yuni’s Sworn Friends**

We can’t discuss [Gun Princess Yuni] without mentioning her two life-long companions, known as the Gun Princess’ Shield and the Gun Princess’ Sword. But how did she originally meet these two? I’d like to take a brief moment to give some details on them here. <img style="float:right;margin-left:20px" src="http://tinyink.com.vn/ab/images/0327.jpg"/>

The girl who is known as the Gun Princess’ Shield was [Shield Coat Fierte]. She never left [Yuni]’s side, and lived to protect her. Their first meeting was when they were both very young.

[Fierte] was an orphan who was raised by [Ben MacLachlan]. Local stories say she was the last survivor of a royal family, but there has never been any documents or records that support this.

It’s generally accepted among historians that [Fierte] and [Yuni] met while Ben was passing his gun techniques down to [Yuni]. That was when they first became friends.

[Fierte]’s personality was the total opposite of [Yuni]’s. She was the silent sarcastic type, and never spoke more than a word or two to anyone she did not know well. It was said that she was a girl who wore a steel mask.

A few years after [Yuni] left Ben’s care to live as a bounty hunter, the two were reunited as competitors. They were both after the same wanted criminal.

Whatever happened during that encounter, it is documented that [Fierte] arrived with Ben, and left with [Yuni]. From then on, [Fierte] would not leave her side until the end of her life.

The one called the Gun Princess’ Sword was a boy named [Mizalio]. When they first met they were on opposite sides of the law, [Yuni] being the bounty hunter and [Mizalio] being the criminal.

At the time, [Mizalio] was the leader of a gang of thieves that called themselves The Wasteland Wolves. It was made up entirely by orphan boys who had been disturbing the peace.

The adults of their town were having such a hard time trying to control them, that they soon put a bounty on their heads. That was when [Yuni] showed up, offering to capture them.

It was a big gang, but after all they were only a group of amateur boys.

At this point [Yuni] was already a master bounty hunter who had caught several hardened criminals. The Wasteland Wolves were no match for her.

<img style="float:left;margin-right:20px" src="http://tinyink.com.vn/ab/images/0442.jpg"/> But when [Yuni] found out they were just a group of boys, she decided not to turn them in as wanted criminals. Instead, she let all of them go free.

[Mizalio] was so astonished by her strength that he ended up following her around to figure out why she was so strong.

Local stories say that [Fierte] and [Mizalio] got along like a dog and a monkey. They were always arguing, but [Fierte]’s sharp tongue and icy stare always left [Mizalio] speechless at the end.

Despite following [Yuni] around, [Mizalio] had no skills whatsoever. However, through force of his own will he eventually learned to generate magic swords from spirit energy, and become a famous swordsman.

**The Purpose of Heierrat’s Establishment**

A question of much debate among scholars is: Why did [Yuni] think of establishing the country of Heierrat?I believe it’s related to her personal history.

From when the establishment of Heierrat first appeared in newspapers, correspondence and other documentation, the news always was accompanied by quotes from [Yuni] herself, saying she wished for a place where those without homes could live in peace or a peaceful country for anyone, despite race or creed.

Then why would such a place be known as the Home of Mercenaries?

Her Mercenary soldiers thought the true purpose of their occupation was to keep peace and fight for the peace of other nations. They were wanderers, because they didn’t have the power to fight for themselves. It was impossible to establish a town, only to have it destroyed by evil forces while all the fighting men were off handling someone else’s war.

The people of the wastelands also valued independent thought, and felt that all the problems happening in Lavato’s great kingdoms were caused by leaders abusing their power.

This is what the people believed, and what [Yuni] believed herself.

So Heierrat was the dream of a girl without a homeland, a hope of a peaceful place for mercenaries to live and come home to.

So exactly what events transpired that led to Heierrat’s establishment? In my next essay, I will directly address establishment of Mercenary Kingdom Heierrat.
